# What it is?
It is a CRUD using MySQL-database and its package.

# What was the purpose?
Initial, I was trying to show myself that I was in a good level now... 

# My conclusion
No, I am not in a good level, one more time, I was getting so happy because I was learning a lot of  new things at the same time, I lost the control. I am getting my time to reflect about it.

# Next move
Probably, I will try to learn some things about python.

# Assessment
5/10 => I learned so much
